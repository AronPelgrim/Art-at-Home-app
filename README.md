Welcome to this repository. Here you can find my art app called **Art @ Home**. The concept is that the user can view art from the Rijksmuseum on their device. The user can look for their favourite artist and then the app will load in 5 paintings of that artist. If you click on the image, the user will arrive on the detail page, where they can view their favourite piece of art.

Follow this link to check out the full app!

## API
For this project, I'm using the Rijksdata API. To start using the data, you need to obtain an API key by registering for a Rijksstudio account. You will be given a key instantly upon request, which you can find at the advanced settings of your Rijksstudio account. Some of the data elements that you can use from the API are the ```webImage``` to obtain the image, ```title``` for a short description, ```longTitle``` for a long description, ```principalOrFirstMaker``` for the name of the artist and ```id```, for the id of the painting.
